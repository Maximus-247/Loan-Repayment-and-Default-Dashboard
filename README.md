# Loan Approval Trends and Default Analysis Dashboard
## Overview
This dashboard provides insights into loan approval trends and default analysis across various loan grades and purposes. It aims to highlight patterns in approval rates and default behavior, empowering decision-makers to optimize loan-granting strategies.

## Objectives
1. Analyze loan approval distribution by grade.
2. Understand approval rate variations across loan grades.
3. Investigate historical default patterns by loan grade and purpose.
4. Correlate loan purposes with default probabilities for better risk management.
## Key Findings
## Loan Approval Trends:

Loan Grade D has the highest approved loans (2.1K), followed by B (1.7K) and C (1.3K).
Approval rates increase significantly from Grade A (0.11) to Grade G (0.98).
Default Patterns:

Historical defaults are highest for Grade D loans (10.11K or 32.75%) and Grade C loans (9.87K or 31.98%).
Loan purposes Business Use and Debt Consolidation show higher default counts compared to others.
Purpose-Specific Observations:

Education Loans have fewer defaults (1.1K out of 5K).
Business Use loans have a notable default count (1.6K out of 4.5K), indicating moderate risk.
## Conclusion
Approval rates tend to favor higher-risk grades (E, F, G) despite their smaller approval volumes.
Default patterns reveal that loans for Business Use and Debt Consolidation carry relatively higher risks.
Historical data shows a concentration of defaults in Grades C and D, suggesting these grades warrant closer scrutiny.
## Recommendations
Strategic Lending:
Limit approvals for higher-risk grades (E, F, G) unless supported by strong applicant credentials.
Enhanced Risk Assessment:
Increase due diligence for Grades C and D, considering their significant default contributions.
Purpose-Specific Strategies:
Design targeted interventions for Business Use and Debt Consolidation loans, such as collateral requirements or stricter terms.
Default Management:
Monitor trends in default rates and implement predictive analytics to refine risk models.
Promotion of Low-Risk Loans:
Focus on Education loans due to their lower default likelihood.
