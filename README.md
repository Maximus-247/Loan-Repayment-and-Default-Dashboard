# Loan Approval Trends and Default Analysis Dashboard
## Overview
This dashboard presents insights derived from the loan data of the Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe (CBZ). It focuses on loan approval trends and default analysis across different loan grades and purposes. By leveraging this data, the analysis highlights key approval patterns and default behaviors, offering actionable insights to enhance the bank's risk management and lending strategies.

## Objectives
1. Analyze loan approval distribution by grade.
2. Understand approval rate variations across loan grades.
3. Investigate historical default patterns by loan grade and purpose.
4. Correlate loan purposes with default probabilities for better risk management.
## Key Findings
## Loan Approval Trends:

Loan Grade D has the highest approved loans (2.1K), followed by B (1.7K) and C (1.3K).
Approval rates increase significantly from Grade A (0.11) to Grade G (0.98).
## Default Patterns:

Historical defaults are highest for Grade D loans (10.11K or 32.75%) and Grade C loans (9.87K or 31.98%).
Loan purposes Business Use and Debt Consolidation show higher default counts compared to others.
## Purpose-Specific Observations:

Education Loans have fewer defaults (1.1K out of 5K).
Business Use loans have a notable default count (1.6K out of 4.5K), indicating moderate risk.
## Conclusion
1. Approval rates tend to favor higher-risk grades (E, F, G) despite their smaller approval volumes.
2. Default patterns reveal that loans for Business Use and Debt Consolidation carry relatively higher risks.
3. Historical data shows a concentration of defaults in Grades C and D, suggesting these grades warrant closer scrutiny.
## Recommendations
1. Strategic Lending:
Limit approvals for higher-risk grades (E, F, G) unless supported by strong applicant credentials.
2. Enhanced Risk Assessment:
Increase due diligence for Grades C and D, considering their significant default contributions.
3. Purpose-Specific Strategies:
Design targeted interventions for Business Use and Debt Consolidation loans, such as collateral requirements or stricter terms.
4. Default Management:
Monitor trends in default rates and implement predictive analytics to refine risk models.
5. Promotion of Low-Risk Loans:
Focus on Education loans due to their lower default likelihood.
